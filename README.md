This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Welcome to Projask
This is Phase 1 of Projask - a project management, task management app that will allow users to assign tasks to their user base, and keep track of their own tasks. 
Currently, in Phase 1 we have implemented Sign up, Log In, Log out, Create, Read, Update tasks in the app

Future development of this app will allow users to add projects, assign tasks to projects, assign tasks to users, allow one to integrate with their Google Calendar to schedule time for projects and tasks and more. This is a work in development and will gradually show more and more skill of React / Redux frontend with a Rails API backend.

You will also need the backend rails server which can be found here: https://github.com/NYHolzer/projask-backend.git.

Here please run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
Next start it up by running `npm start`.
